[RedisInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) Workbench allows you to leverage the command-line interaction to visualize many Redis Stack capabilities and data structures like
- [Search](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/) capability
- [time series](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/) data stucture
- [graph](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph/) data model
-  core Redis commands - like [COMMAND LIST](https://redis.io/commands/client-list/).

Though, sometimes it may not be enough.
For such cases, Workbench supports plugin visualizations that empower you to create your own custom data visualization as a plugin to cover your use cases and work with it in Workbench.

This repository describes the process to create your own data visualizations for RedisInsight Workbench.
You can find documentation that describes the entire process [here](https://github.com/RedisInsight/Packages/docs).

You can also look at and try the following examples of plugin visualizations for Workbench:

- [CLIENT LIST](https://github.com/RedisInsight/Packages/tree/main/clients-list-example) visualization
- [Random key](https://github.com/RedisInsight/Packages/tree/main/random-key-example) example
